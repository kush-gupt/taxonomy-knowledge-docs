      An HPC batch system must generate and provide a complete set of statistics for
      the jobs that are run and the resources that are consumed.  This begins with a
      list of job records, both individual and aggregated.  Users and managers will
      want to look back over time to see what jobs ran, what resources they ran on,
      and whether they ran successfully to completion.  Managers also require reports
      of how computing resource investments are utilized and by which users, groups
      and projects.  Fair-share calculations are based off the difference between what
      resources were promised and which resources were ultimately used.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is one of the responsibilities of an HPC batch system?
        answer: |-
          An HPC batch system is responsible for generating and providing a complete set
          of statistics for the jobs that are run and the resources that are consumed.
      - question: |-
          What kind of information can be obtained from the job records provided by an HPC
          batch system?
        answer: |-
          The job records provided by an HPC batch system include information about the
          jobs that have run, the resources they ran on, and whether they ran successfully
          to completion.
      - question: |-
          Given the information about fair-share calculations, how are they typically
          determined?
        answer: |-
          Fair-share calculations are based off the difference between what resources were
          promised and which resources were ultimately used.

      This primer introduces the concepts of High Performance Computing, scheduling,
      and resource management.  It focuses first on the state of the art and then
      introduces the issues under consideration in the design of a next generation
      resource manager known as Flux.  The Flux design addresses not just the
      challenges of resource management at a much larger scale of systems, but it also
      enables and promotes a much broader and richer model that invites collaboration
      with areas whose requirements cannot be met in current systems.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are the main aspects addressed by the design of the Flux resource
          manager?
        answer: |-
          The design of the Flux resource manager addresses the challenges of resource
          management at a larger scale of systems and enables and promotes collaboration
          with areas whose requirements cannot be met in current systems.
      - question: Based on the information provided, why was the Flux resource manager
          designed?
        answer: |-
          The Flux resource manager was designed to address the challenges of resource
          management at a larger scale of systems and to enable and promote collaboration
          with areas whose requirements cannot be met in current systems.

      The term High performance computing (HPC) as it is commonly used refers to a
      category of computing systems that combine computing power from multiple units
      to deliver vastly higher performance than desktop computers can provide.  HPC is
      distinguished not just by computing power.  HPC systems are designed to run a
      variety of large applications for extended periods of time in order to solve
      complex problems.  HPC is distinguished from web servers in that they dedicate
      requested resources to run applications provided by users.  Current HPC systems
      are distinguished from cloud services like AWS in that they generally provide a
      single operating system with a runtime environment managed by the facility.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is commonly understood by the term High performance computing
          (HPC)?
        answer: |-
          High performance computing (HPC) refers to a category of computing systems that
          combine computing power from multiple units to deliver vastly higher performance
          than desktop computers.
      - question: How does HPC differ from web servers and cloud services like AWS?
        answer: |-
          HPC systems differ from web servers in that they dedicate requested resources to
          run applications provided by users. They differ from cloud services like AWS in
          that they generally provide a single operating system with a runtime environment
          managed by the facility.
      - question: |-
          Given the description, why are HPC systems more suitable for solving complex
          problems over extended periods compared to desktop computers or cloud services?
        answer: |-
          HPC systems are designed to run a variety of large applications for extended
          periods of time in order to solve complex problems, making them more suitable
          for such tasks compared to desktop computers or cloud services.

      The configuration of each of the above operations makes up what is known as the
      center's policy.  The computing center management effectively enters into an
      agreement with their users to establish and then enforce a well-defined policy
      for how jobs are selected to run and what resources their jobs are allocated.
      Users need to know that they will receive the service they are entitled to and
      evidence needs to be available to convince users that they are received the
      service they were promised or sold.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What makes up the configuration of each operation in the above context?
        answer: |-
          The configuration of each operation makes up what is known as the center's
          policy.
      - question: |-
          What does the computing center management agree to establish and enforce with

          policy for how jobs are selected to run and what resources their jobs are

      - question: |-
          Why does evidence need to be available to convince users about the service they
          received?
        answer: |-
          Evidence needs to be available to convince users that they are received the
          service they were promised or sold, ensuring trust and transparency in the
          service provision.
